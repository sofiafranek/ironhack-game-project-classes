            Great! You have selected the Novice level. The words will have less than 5 characters
            and will be moving relatively slowly. Good luck!
          </p>

          <p>
            Amazing! You have selected the Intermediate level. The words will have between 5 and 10
            characters and will be moving a little faster than Novice. Good luck!

            Excellent! You have selected the Expert level. The words will have more than 6
            characters and will be moving a fast to try and catch them. Good luck!

            Fabulous! You have selected the Bonus level. This level is fast and only has single
            characters but... it is case sensitive so look out for capital letters. Good luck!
          </p>

            Brilliant! You have selected the Bonus Bonus level. This level is fast and only has
            single characters but... it is special symbols & numbers only so look outv. Good luck!
          </p>

            Exquisite! You have selected the Super Bonus level. This level is really hard and the
            strongest will only survive. Good luck!
